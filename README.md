## Implemented features:

2. Loading spinner before the data is loaded.
3. Removing tours from the list.
4. Implement the "read more" functionality. When click on the "read more" button, expands the description of the tour.
5. Implemented a "re-fetch" functionality by adding a button, so when clicked, re-fetches the tours data from the URL and updates the state of the Tours component
